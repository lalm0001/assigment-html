        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>
        I am currently a student at <em>Algonquin</em> College, where I am completing my first level in the interactive media design program.
         I chose this path because I love blending technology with artistic creativity.
         My dream is to become a professional photographer for the upcoming World Cup in 2026<sup>th</sup>.
         I am working very hard every day to master my camera settings and learn how to capture the most unique moments that tell a story to the world through a single lens.

     <p>
    I also have a lot of hobbies that I enjoy during my free time, for instance doing kickboxing on the weekend to stay fit, and I also play soccer.
     My favourite player is <abbr title="Cristiano Ronaldo">CR7</abbr>.
      In addition, I enjoy playing video games like Call of Duty, which helps me develop my reflexes and strategic thinking.
       I believe that having diverse interests outside of school is very important to maintain a healthy balance and stay creative in my professional design work.
